Structure
=========

This section describes the overall structure of the FFRM model. 
The mathematical structure of FFRM is formulated to maximise a fossil fuel powerplant revenue in order to meet a target generation under a number of regimes. It consists of a series of sets, parameters and equations used in the optimisation process.

- A core element of the model is to consider both a reference (business-as-usual) and a decarbonisation generation trajectory under these various regimes.
- A functionality of the model is to also limit the level of asset stranding. So if a powerplant's net revenue falls below a certain level or a plant load factor (a measure of how much the plant is being utilised), then the plant cannot be in operation.
